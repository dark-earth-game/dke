# Dark Earth 

Welcome to the Dark Earth Game Reimplementation.

The main goal of this project is to create a modern and portable engine for the Dark Earth pc game and have a clean codebase for learning purposes. Dark Earth was created by Kalisto Entertaiment in 1997 which is no longer an active business and we believe it is important to preserve the game and its universe and allow it to be played on modern systems by future generations.

## Status

The project is in its initial stages.

We are currently working on disassembling the game and understanding the game engine and its file formats.

Check the [TODO.md](TODO.md) for more comprehensive list of upcoming features and tasks.

## How to use it

Place the contents of the game folder into the bin folder and run the executable.


## Compiling

The project tries to be cross-platform with minimal dependencies to facilitate the compilation process on different platforms. Mac OS X and Windows are the main platforms we are targeting.

## Mac OS X/Linux

> make

> make run

## Windows (cross-compiled with mingw-w64)

> make PLATFORM=windows

## Releases

GitHub Actions builds macOS (arm64, x86_64), Linux and Windows on every push. To publish a release, rename the `## Unreleased` heading in [CHANGES.md](CHANGES.md) to the version (for example `## 0.1.0 - 2026-11-01`), commit, then push a matching tag:

> git tag v0.1.0 && git push origin v0.1.0

The release holds the engine only; players add the files from their own copy of the game.

## Disassembly

In the disassembly folder you will find the IDA Free v8.4 project files for the game. The executable used was the patched version of the game with no CD protection.
